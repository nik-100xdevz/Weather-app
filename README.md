# Weather App 🌤️

This is a simple Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to get real-time weather information for any location using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features 🚀
- Get current weather information by city name.
- Displays temperature, weather conditions, and icons.
- User-friendly and responsive interface.

## Demo 🌐
You can view the app by opening the `index.html` file in your browser or [host it online](https://pages.github.com/) to make it accessible to others.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **HTML**: For structuring the app.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: To fetch and display weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## How to Use 🖥️
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nik-100xdevz/Weather-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd Weather-app/whether app
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   - Double-click the `index.html` file, or
   - Use a live server if you have one installed (e.g., VSCode Live Server).

## Prerequisites 📋
- To fetch live weather data, ensure you have a valid **OpenWeatherMap API Key**.  
  - Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and generate your API key.

## Example API Integration
Here’s the JavaScript code snippet where the API is integrated:
```javascript
const apiKey = "your_api_key_here";
fetch(`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=cityName&appid=${apiKey}`)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```
